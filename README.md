## Workflow when using these slides

1. Fork this repo and clone your fork.
1. Install `renv` and run `renv::restore()` to install dependencies from
   the `renv.lock` file provided with this repo.
1. Update `slides/slides.Rmd` for your presentation
   (`xaringan::inf_mr(slides/slides.Rmd)` is helpful for local rendering as you
   develop your changes).
1. In your fork, enable GitHub Pages with `/` selected as the source folder.
   You'll be able to find your presentation at
   `<your-username>.github.io/simChef-culinary-school/slides/slides.html`.
1. Have a great presentation!
1. Back in this repo, create a folder like `slides/talks/YYYY-MM-DD-place` and
   add your `slides.Rmd`, `css/culinary.css`, rendered `slides.html`, and any
   other files needed to reproduce your talk (e.g., files you added to
   `images/`). Other than the `.html`, no need to add files generated by the
   `.Rmd`.
1. If you want to contribute updates to this repo's template, please feel free
   to just make them (don't forget to add your name to the `author` field and
   update the `date` field in the `slides.Rmd` preamble) or open a PR if you
   want feedback.
1. We can also create branches to track different versions of these slides for
   different purposes/audiences.

### Customizing the look and feel

The first R chunk in `slides.Rmd`, named `xaringan-themer`, controls the theme,
fonts, and colors for the slides. Check out the 
[`xaringanthemer docs`](https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanthemer) for more info.

There are some custom CSS rules defined in `slides/css/culinary.css`. The 
[mdn web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) provide a good
reference for writing CSS.

### Keyboard shortcuts while presenting

- Type `F` for full-screen.
- Type `O` to open a tile overview of the presentation
- Type `Alt/Option-F` to fit slides to full window (refresh to return to normal).
- Type `Ctrl-F` to search within the slides (click the magnifying glass icon to remove search box).
- Type a number following by `Enter` to jump to a specific slide number (e.g.,
  `10 Enter` is like changing the end of the URL to `#10`).
- Press the `Home` key to go to the title slide.
- Press the `End` key to go to the final slide.

### How these slides were made

These slides are written in `Rmarkdown` using the R package
[`xaringan`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/xaringan.html).

These extensions make `xaringan` even more powerful:

- [xaringanthemer](https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanthemer)
- [xaringanExtra](https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanExtra)
